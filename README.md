Conky Configurations
====================

### Description
> Here you will find my new and old conky configurations.  In some cases they are distro specific (e.g.: Mint / Arch) and might require some minor changes.  These configurations also reflect specific interfaces.  For example, full on GUI or primarily CLI wiht a header / status bar.

### Credits
> The vast majority of these are modified versions of [NoobsLab](http://www.noobslab.com/2012/07/conky-collection-for-ubuntulinux.html) conkies that I've adapted to my liking.  Much of the original documentation (e.g. Headers in config files) have been left intact with little or no modification to the credentialing on my behalf.
