### Description
> New and old conky configurations for the sharing!  Currently, I use *dwm* and many conky(s) and configurations.  Those are actively maintained in [.conky](.conky).  Previously, I've used [i3](i3) and assorted desktop environments (see [de](de)).

### Credits
> Many of the [de](de) configs are variants of the originals found at [NoobsLab](http://www.noobslab.com/2012/07/conky-collection-for-ubuntulinux.html).  In such cases much of the original documentation has been left intact and modified on my behalf.
