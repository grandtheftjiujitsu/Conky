Conky Configurations
====================

by gtbjj

These are the scripts and configurations for my active conky set up (using ```dwm```).  Former variations for ```i3``` and desktop environments 
(such as ```cinnamon```) can be found in the [archive](archive/) folder.  Screenshots can be found in my [public Google Drive 
folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2RH_BSaD6YPY1dZR0x1S2QxZ1U&usp=sharing)

### Credits
Many of the desktop environment configs are variants of the originals found at 
[NoobsLab](http://www.noobslab.com/2012/07/conky-collection-for-ubuntulinux.html).  In such cases much of the original documentation has been 
left intact and modified on my behalf.
